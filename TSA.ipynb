    "### Conclusion\n",
    "#### For implementing sentiment analysis using NLTK, we need a corpora to compare the text with. TextBlob provides this feature built-in, it also extracts the most important parts that influence the sentiment of the text. In NLTK, sentiment could be done as a classification task, but one would need a labeled dataset for training (extracting features).\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "#### Labeled datasets could be used to measure the performance of the algorithm. It would interesting to see the how stemming/lemmatization could affect the accuracy."
